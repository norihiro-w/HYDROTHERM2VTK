HS2VTK.py is a small Python script for converting HYDROTHERM (https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/software/hydrotherm/) output files to legacy VTK files. 
Please note that the program is under development and may fails. 

The script can be executed as
```
python HS2VTK.py <HYDROTHERM output dir> <HYDROTHERM output file suffix> <VTK file base name>
```
